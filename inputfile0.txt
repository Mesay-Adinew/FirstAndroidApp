Spark is a fast and general cluster computing system for Big Data. It provides
high-level APIs in Scala, Java, Python, and R, and an optimized engine that
supports general computation graphs for data analysis. It also supports a
rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and DataFrames,
MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing,
and Spark Streaming for stream processing.
You can find the latest Spark documentation, including a programming
guide, on the project web page
This README file only contains basic setup instructions.
Spark is built using Apache Maven
To build Spark and its example programs, run:
 You do not need to do this if you downloaded a pre-built package.
You can build Spark using more than one thread by using the -T option with Maven, see "Parallel builds in Maven 3"
For general development tips, including info on developing Spark using an IDE, see 
will run the Pi example locally.
You can set the MASTER environment variable when running examples to submit
examples to a cluster. 
"yarn" to run on YARN, and "local" to run
locally with one thread, or "local" to run locally with N threads. You
can also use an abbreviated class name if the class is in the `examples`
package. For instance: 
Many of the example programs print usage help if no params are given.

You can build Spark using more than one thread by using the -T option with Maven, see "Parallel builds in Maven 3"
For general development tips, including info on developing Spark using an IDE, see 
will run the Pi example locally.
You can set the MASTER environment variable when running examples to submit
examples to a cluster. 
"yarn" to run on YARN, and "local" to run
locally with one thread, or "local" to run locally with N threads. You
can also use an abbreviated class name if the class is in the `examples`
package. For instance: 
Many of the example programs print usage help if no params are given.
Spark uses the Hadoop core library to talk to HDFS and other Hadoop-supported
storage systems. Because the protocols have changed in different versions of
Hadoop, you must build Spark against the same version that your cluster runs.
Please refer to the build documentation at
Specifying the Hadoop Version and Enabling YARN
for detailed guidance on building for a particular distribution of Hadoop, including
building for particular Hive and Hive Thriftserver distributions.

Spark is a fast and general cluster computing system for Big Data. It provides
high-level APIs in Scala, Java, Python, and R, and an optimized engine that
supports general computation graphs for data analysis. It also supports a
rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and DataFrames,
MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing,
and Spark Streaming for stream processing.

building for particular Hive and Hive Thriftserver distributions.

Spark is a fast and general cluster computing system for Big Data. It provides
high-level APIs in Scala, Java, Python, and R, and an optimized engine that
supports general computation graphs for data analysis. It also supports a
rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and DataFrames,
MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing,
and Spark Streaming for stream processing.
You can find the latest Spark documentation, including a programming
guide, on the project web page
This README file only contains basic setup instructions.
Spark is built using Apache Maven
To build Spark and its example programs, run:
 You do not need to do this if you downloaded a pre-built package.
You can build Spark using more than one thread by using the -T option with Maven, see "Parallel builds in Maven 3"
For general development tips, including info on developing Spark using an IDE, see 
will run the Pi example locally.
You can set the MASTER environment variable when running examples to submit
examples to a cluster. 
"yarn" to run on YARN, and "local" to run
locally with one thread, or "local" to run locally with N threads. You
can also use an abbreviated class name if the class is in the `examples`
package. For instance: 
Many of the example programs print usage help if no params are given.
Spark uses the Hadoop core library to talk to HDFS and other Hadoop-supported
storage systems. Because the protocols have changed in different versions of
Hadoop, you must build Spark against the same version that your cluster runs.

Spark uses the Hadoop core library to talk to HDFS and other Hadoop-supported
storage systems. Because the protocols have changed in different versions of
Hadoop, you must build Spark against the same version that your cluster runs.
Please refer to the build documentation at
Specifying the Hadoop Version and Enabling YARN
for detailed guidance on building for a particular distribution of Hadoop, including
building for particular Hive and Hive Thriftserver distributions.

Spark is a fast and general cluster computing system for Big Data. It provides
high-level APIs in Scala, Java, Python, and R, and an optimized engine that
supports general computation graphs for data analysis. It also supports a
rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and DataFrames,
MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing,
and Spark Streaming for stream processing.

Spark is a fast and general cluster computing system for Big Data. It provides
high-level APIs in Scala, Java, Python, and R, and an optimized engine that
supports general computation graphs for data analysis. It also supports a
rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and DataFrames,
MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing,
and Spark Streaming for stream processing.
You can find the latest Spark documentation, including a programming
guide, on the project web page
This README file only contains basic setup instructions.
Spark is built using Apache Maven
To build Spark and its example programs, run:
 You do not need to do this if you downloaded a pre-built package.
You can build Spark using more than one thread by using the -T option with Maven, see "Parallel builds in Maven 3"
For general development tips, including info on developing Spark using an IDE, see 
will run the Pi example locally.
You can set the MASTER environment variable when running examples to submit
examples to a cluster. 
"yarn" to run on YARN, and "local" to run
locally with one thread, or "local" to run locally with N threads. You
can also use an abbreviated class name if the class is in the `examples`
package. For instance: 
Many of the example programs print usage help if no params are given.
Spark uses the Hadoop core library to talk to HDFS and other Hadoop-supported
storage systems. Because the protocols have changed in different versions of
Hadoop, you must build Spark against the same version that your cluster runs.

Spark is a fast and general cluster computing system for Big Data. It provides
high-level APIs in Scala, Java, Python, and R, and an optimized engine that
supports general computation graphs for data analysis. It also supports a
rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and DataFrames,
MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing,
and Spark Streaming for stream processing.

building for particular Hive and Hive Thriftserver distributions.

Spark is a fast and general cluster computing system for Big Data. It provides
high-level APIs in Scala, Java, Python, and R, and an optimized engine that
supports general computation graphs for data analysis. It also supports a
rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and DataFrames,
MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing,
and Spark Streaming for stream processing.
You can find the latest Spark documentation, including a programming
guide, on the project web page
This README file only contains basic setup instructions.
Spark is built using Apache Maven
To build Spark and its example programs, run:
 You do not need to do this if you downloaded a pre-built package.
You can build Spark using more than one thread by using the -T option with Maven, see "Parallel builds in Maven 3"
For general development tips, including info on developing Spark using an IDE, see 
will run the Pi example locally.
You can set the MASTER environment variable when running examples to submit
examples to a cluster. 
"yarn" to run on YARN, and "local" to run
locally with one thread, or "local" to run locally with N threads. You
can also use an abbreviated class name if the class is in the `examples`
package. For instance: 
Many of the example programs print usage help if no params are given.
Spark uses the Hadoop core library to talk to HDFS and other Hadoop-supported
storage systems. Because the protocols have changed in different versions of
Hadoop, you must build Spark against the same version that your cluster runs.

Spark uses the Hadoop core library to talk to HDFS and other Hadoop-supported
storage systems. Because the protocols have changed in different versions of
Hadoop, you must build Spark against the same version that your cluster runs.
Please refer to the build documentation at
Specifying the Hadoop Version and Enabling YARN
for detailed guidance on building for a particular distribution of Hadoop, including
building for particular Hive and Hive Thriftserver distributions.

Spark is a fast and general cluster computing system for Big Data. It provides
high-level APIs in Scala, Java, Python, and R, and an optimized engine that
supports general computation graphs for data analysis. It also supports a
rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and DataFrames,
MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing,
and Spark Streaming for stream processing.

Spark is a fast and general cluster computing system for Big Data. It provides
high-level APIs in Scala, Java, Python, and R, and an optimized engine that
supports general computation graphs for data analysis. It also supports a
rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and DataFrames,
MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing,
and Spark Streaming for stream processing.
You can find the latest Spark documentation, including a programming
guide, on the project web page
This README file only contains basic setup instructions.
Spark is built using Apache Maven
To build Spark and its example programs, run:
 You do not need to do this if you downloaded a pre-built package.
You can build Spark using more than one thread by using the -T option with Maven, see "Parallel builds in Maven 3"
For general development tips, including info on developing Spark using an IDE, see 
will run the Pi example locally.
You can set the MASTER environment variable when running examples to submit
examples to a cluster. 
"yarn" to run on YARN, and "local" to run
locally with one thread, or "local" to run locally with N threads. You
can also use an abbreviated class name if the class is in the `examples`
package. For instance: 
Many of the example programs print usage help if no params are given.
Spark uses the Hadoop core library to talk to HDFS and other Hadoop-supported
storage systems. Because the protocols have changed in different versions of
Hadoop, you must build Spark against the same version that your cluster runs.

Spark uses the Hadoop core library to talk to HDFS and other Hadoop-supported
storage systems. Because the protocols have changed in different versions of
Hadoop, you must build Spark against the same version that your cluster runs.
Please refer to the build documentation at

for detailed guidance on building for a particular distribution of Hadoop, including
building for particular Hive and Hive Thriftserver distributions.

Spark is a fast and general cluster computing system for Big Data. It provides
high-level APIs in Scala, Java, Python, and R, and an optimized engine that
supports general computation graphs for data analysis. It also supports a
rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and DataFrames,
MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing,
and Spark Streaming for stream processing.

Spark is built using Apache Maven
To build Spark and its example programs, run:
 You do not need to do this if you downloaded a pre-built package.
You can build Spark using more than one thread by using the -T option with Maven, see "Parallel builds in Maven 3"
For general development tips, including info on developing Spark using an IDE, see 
will run the Pi example locally.
You can set the MASTER environment variable when running examples to submit
examples to a cluster. 
"yarn" to run on YARN, and "local" to run
locally with one thread, or "local" to run locally with N threads. You
can also use an abbreviated class name if the class is in the `examples`
package. For instance: 
Many of the example programs print usage help if no params are given.
Spark uses the Hadoop core library to talk to HDFS and other Hadoop-supported
storage systems. Because the protocols have changed in different versions of
Hadoop, you must build Spark against the same version that your cluster runs.
Please refer to the build documentation at
Specifying the Hadoop Version and Enabling YARN
for detailed guidance on building for a particular distribution of Hadoop, including
building for particular Hive and Hive Thriftserver distributions.

Spark is a fast and general cluster computing system for Big Data. It provides
high-level APIs in Scala, Java, Python, and R, and an optimized engine that
supports general computation graphs for data analysis. It also supports a
rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and DataFrames,
MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing,
and Spark Streaming for stream processing.

Spark uses the Hadoop core library to talk to HDFS and other Hadoop-supported
storage systems. Because the protocols have changed in different versions of
Hadoop, you must build Spark against the same version that your cluster runs.
Please refer to the build documentation at

for detailed guidance on building for a particular distribution of Hadoop, including
building for particular Hive and Hive Thriftserver distributions.

Spark is a fast and general cluster computing system for Big Data. It provides
high-level APIs in Scala, Java, Python, and R, and an optimized engine that
supports general computation graphs for data analysis. It also supports a
rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and DataFrames,
MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing,
and Spark Streaming for stream processing.

Spark is built using Apache Maven
To build Spark and its example programs, run:
 You do not need to do this if you downloaded a pre-built package.
You can build Spark using more than one thread by using the -T option with Maven, see "Parallel builds in Maven 3"
For general development tips, including info on developing Spark using an IDE, see 
will run the Pi example locally.
You can set the MASTER environment variable when running examples to submit
examples to a cluster. 
"yarn" to run on YARN, and "local" to run
locally with one thread, or "local" to run locally with N threads. You
can also use an abbreviated class name if the class is in the `examples`
package. For instance: 
Many of the example programs print usage help if no params are given.
Spark uses the Hadoop core library to talk to HDFS and other Hadoop-supported
storage systems. Because the protocols have changed in different versions of
Hadoop, you must build Spark against the same version that your cluster runs.
Please refer to the build documentation at
Specifying the Hadoop Version and Enabling YARN
for detailed guidance on building for a particular distribution of Hadoop, including
building for particular Hive and Hive Thriftserver distributions.

Spark is a fast and general cluster computing system for Big Data. It provides
high-level APIs in Scala, Java, Python, and R, and an optimized engine that
supports general computation graphs for data analysis. It also supports a
rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and DataFrames,
MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing,
and Spark Streaming for stream processing.

Spark is a fast and general cluster computing system for Big Data. It provides
high-level APIs in Scala, Java, Python, and R, and an optimized engine that
supports general computation graphs for data analysis. It also supports a
rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and DataFrames,
MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing,
and Spark Streaming for stream processing.

will run the Pi example locally.
You can set the MASTER environment variable when running examples to submit
examples to a cluster. 
"yarn" to run on YARN, and "local" to run
locally with one thread, or "local" to run locally with N threads. You
can also use an abbreviated class name if the class is in the `examples`
package. For instance: 
Many of the example programs print usage help if no params are given.

Spark is built using Apache Maven
To build Spark and its example programs, run:
 You do not need to do this if you downloaded a pre-built package.
You can build Spark using more than one thread by using the -T option with Maven, see "Parallel builds in Maven 3"
For general development tips, including info on developing Spark using an IDE, see 
will run the Pi example locally.
You can set the MASTER environment variable when running examples to submit
examples to a cluster. 
"yarn" to run on YARN, and "local" to run
locally with one thread, or "local" to run locally with N threads. You
can also use an abbreviated class name if the class is in the `examples`
package. For instance: 
Many of the example programs print usage help if no params are given.
Spark uses the Hadoop core library to talk to HDFS and other Hadoop-supported
storage systems. Because the protocols have changed in different versions of
Hadoop, you must build Spark against the same version that your cluster runs.
Please refer to the build documentation at
Specifying the Hadoop Version and Enabling YARN
for detailed guidance on building for a particular distribution of Hadoop, including
building for particular Hive and Hive Thriftserver distributions.

Spark is a fast and general cluster computing system for Big Data. It provides
high-level APIs in Scala, Java, Python, and R, and an optimized engine that
supports general computation graphs for data analysis. It also supports a
rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and DataFrames,
MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing,
and Spark Streaming for stream processing.

storage systems. Because the protocols have changed in different versions of
Hadoop, you must build Spark against the same version that your cluster runs.
Please refer to the build documentation at
Specifying the Hadoop Version and Enabling YARN
for detailed guidance on building for a particular distribution of Hadoop, including
building for particular Hive and Hive Thriftserver distributions.

Spark is a fast and general cluster computing system for Big Data. It provides
high-level APIs in Scala, Java, Python, and R, and an optimized engine that
supports general computation graphs for data analysis. It also supports a
rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and DataFrames,
MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing,
and Spark Streaming for stream processing.

 You do not need to do this if you downloaded a pre-built package.
You can build Spark using more than one thread by using the -T option with Maven, see "Parallel builds in Maven 3"
For general development tips, including info on developing Spark using an IDE, see 
will run the Pi example locally.
You can set the MASTER environment variable when running examples to submit
examples to a cluster. 
"yarn" to run on YARN, and "local" to run
locally with one thread, or "local" to run locally with N threads. You
can also use an abbreviated class name if the class is in the `examples`
package. For instance: 
Many of the example programs print usage help if no params are given.
Spark uses the Hadoop core library to talk to HDFS and other Hadoop-supported
storage systems. Because the protocols have changed in different versions of
Hadoop, you must build Spark against the same version that your cluster runs.
Please refer to the build documentation at
Specifying the Hadoop Version and Enabling YARN
for detailed guidance on building for a particular distribution of Hadoop, including
building for particular Hive and Hive Thriftserver distributions.

Spark is a fast and general cluster computing system for Big Data. It provides
high-level APIs in Scala, Java, Python, and R, and an optimized engine that
supports general computation graphs for data analysis. It also supports a
rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and DataFrames,
MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing,
and Spark Streaming for stream processing.

high-level APIs in Scala, Java, Python, and R, and an optimized engine that
supports general computation graphs for data analysis. It also supports a
rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and DataFrames,
MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing,
and Spark Streaming for stream processing.

guide, on the project web page
This README file only contains basic setup instructions.
Spark is built using Apache Maven
To build Spark and its example programs, run:
 You do not need to do this if you downloaded a pre-built package.
You can build Spark using more than one thread by using the -T option with Maven, see "Parallel builds in Maven 3"
For general development tips, including info on developing Spark using an IDE, see 
will run the Pi example locally.
You can set the MASTER environment variable when running examples to submit
examples to a cluster. 
"yarn" to run on YARN, and "local" to run
locally with one thread, or "local" to run locally with N threads. You
can also use an abbreviated class name if the class is in the `examples`
package. For instance: 
Many of the example programs print usage help if no params are given.
Spark uses the Hadoop core library to talk to HDFS and other Hadoop-supported
storage systems. Because the protocols have changed in different versions of
Hadoop, you must build Spark against the same version that your cluster runs.
Please refer to the build documentation at

Spark uses the Hadoop core library to talk to HDFS and other Hadoop-supported
storage systems. Because the protocols have changed in different versions of
Hadoop, you must build Spark against the same version that your cluster runs.
Please refer to the build documentation at

for detailed guidance on building for a particular distribution of Hadoop, including
building for particular Hive and Hive Thriftserver distributions.

Spark is a fast and general cluster computing system for Big Data. It provides
high-level APIs in Scala, Java, Python, and R, and an optimized engine that
supports general computation graphs for data analysis. It also supports a
rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and DataFrames,
MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing,
and Spark Streaming for stream processing.

Spark is built using Apache Maven
To build Spark and its example programs, run:
 You do not need to do this if you downloaded a pre-built package.
You can build Spark using more than one thread by using the -T option with Maven, see "Parallel builds in Maven 3"
For general development tips, including info on developing Spark using an IDE, see 
will run the Pi example locally.
You can set the MASTER environment variable when running examples to submit
examples to a cluster. 
"yarn" to run on YARN, and "local" to run
locally with one thread, or "local" to run locally with N threads. You
can also use an abbreviated class name if the class is in the `examples`
package. For instance: 
Many of the example programs print usage help if no params are given.
Spark uses the Hadoop core library to talk to HDFS and other Hadoop-supported
storage systems. Because the protocols have changed in different versions of
Hadoop, you must build Spark against the same version that your cluster runs.
Please refer to the build documentation at
Specifying the Hadoop Version and Enabling YARN
for detailed guidance on building for a particular distribution of Hadoop, including
building for particular Hive and Hive Thriftserver distributions.

Spark is a fast and general cluster computing system for Big Data. It provides
high-level APIs in Scala, Java, Python, and R, and an optimized engine that
supports general computation graphs for data analysis. It also supports a

Spark uses the Hadoop core library to talk to HDFS and other Hadoop-supported
storage systems. Because the protocols have changed in different versions of
Hadoop, you must build Spark against the same version that your cluster runs.
Please refer to the build documentation at

for detailed guidance on building for a particular distribution of Hadoop, including
building for particular Hive and Hive Thriftserver distributions.

Spark is a fast and general cluster computing system for Big Data. It provides
high-level APIs in Scala, Java, Python, and R, and an optimized engine that
supports general computation graphs for data analysis. It also supports a
rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and DataFrames,
MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing,
and Spark Streaming for stream processing.

Spark is built using Apache Maven
To build Spark and its example programs, run:
 You do not need to do this if you downloaded a pre-built package.
You can build Spark using more than one thread by using the -T option with Maven, see "Parallel builds in Maven 3"
For general development tips, including info on developing Spark using an IDE, see 
will run the Pi example locally.
You can set the MASTER environment variable when running examples to submit
examples to a cluster. 
"yarn" to run on YARN, and "local" to run
locally with one thread, or "local" to run locally with N threads. You
can also use an abbreviated class name if the class is in the `examples`
package. For instance: 
Many of the example programs print usage help if no params are given.
Spark uses the Hadoop core library to talk to HDFS and other Hadoop-supported
storage systems. Because the protocols have changed in different versions of
Hadoop, you must build Spark against the same version that your cluster runs.
Please refer to the build documentation at
Specifying the Hadoop Version and Enabling YARN
for detailed guidance on building for a particular distribution of Hadoop, including
building for particular Hive and Hive Thriftserver distributions.

Spark is a fast and general cluster computing system for Big Data. It provides
high-level APIs in Scala, Java, Python, and R, and an optimized engine that
supports general computation graphs for data analysis. It also supports a
rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and DataFrames,
MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing,
and Spark Streaming for stream processing.

Spark uses the Hadoop core library to talk to HDFS and other Hadoop-supported
storage systems. Because the protocols have changed in different versions of
Hadoop, you must build Spark against the same version that your cluster runs.
Please refer to the build documentation at

for detailed guidance on building for a particular distribution of Hadoop, including
building for particular Hive and Hive Thriftserver distributions.

Spark is a fast and general cluster computing system for Big Data. It provides
high-level APIs in Scala, Java, Python, and R, and an optimized engine that
supports general computation graphs for data analysis. It also supports a
rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and DataFrames,
MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing,
and Spark Streaming for stream processing.

Spark is built using Apache Maven
To build Spark and its example programs, run:
 You do not need to do this if you downloaded a pre-built package.
You can build Spark using more than one thread by using the -T option with Maven, see "Parallel builds in Maven 3"
For general development tips, including info on developing Spark using an IDE, see 
will run the Pi example locally.
You can set the MASTER environment variable when running examples to submit
examples to a cluster. 
"yarn" to run on YARN, and "local" to run
locally with one thread, or "local" to run locally with N threads. You
can also use an abbreviated class name if the class is in the `examples`
package. For instance: 
Many of the example programs print usage help if no params are given.
Spark uses the Hadoop core library to talk to HDFS and other Hadoop-supported
storage systems. Because the protocols have changed in different versions of
Hadoop, you must build Spark against the same version that your cluster runs.
Please refer to the build documentation at
Specifying the Hadoop Version and Enabling YARN
for detailed guidance on building for a particular distribution of Hadoop, including
building for particular Hive and Hive Thriftserver distributions.

Spark is a fast and general cluster computing system for Big Data. It provides
high-level APIs in Scala, Java, Python, and R, and an optimized engine that
supports general computation graphs for data analysis. It also supports a
rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and DataFrames,
MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing,
and Spark Streaming for stream processing.

Spark uses the Hadoop core library to talk to HDFS and other Hadoop-supported
storage systems. Because the protocols have changed in different versions of
Hadoop, you must build Spark against the same version that your cluster runs.
Please refer to the build documentation at

for detailed guidance on building for a particular distribution of Hadoop, including
building for particular Hive and Hive Thriftserver distributions.

Spark is a fast and general cluster computing system for Big Data. It provides
high-level APIs in Scala, Java, Python, and R, and an optimized engine that
supports general computation graphs for data analysis. It also supports a
rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and DataFrames,
MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing,
and Spark Streaming for stream processing.

Spark is built using Apache Maven
To build Spark and its example programs, run:
 You do not need to do this if you downloaded a pre-built package.
You can build Spark using more than one thread by using the -T option with Maven, see "Parallel builds in Maven 3"
For general development tips, including info on developing Spark using an IDE, see 
will run the Pi example locally.
You can set the MASTER environment variable when running examples to submit
examples to a cluster. 
"yarn" to run on YARN, and "local" to run
locally with one thread, or "local" to run locally with N threads. You
can also use an abbreviated class name if the class is in the `examples`
package. For instance: 
Many of the example programs print usage help if no params are given.
Spark uses the Hadoop core library to talk to HDFS and other Hadoop-supported
storage systems. Because the protocols have changed in different versions of
Hadoop, you must build Spark against the same version that your cluster runs.
Please refer to the build documentation at
Specifying the Hadoop Version and Enabling YARN
for detailed guidance on building for a particular distribution of Hadoop, including
building for particular Hive and Hive Thriftserver distributions.

Spark is a fast and general cluster computing system for Big Data. It provides
high-level APIs in Scala, Java, Python, and R, and an optimized engine that
supports general computation graphs for data analysis. It also supports a
rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and DataFrames,
MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing,
and Spark Streaming for stream processing.

Spark is a fast and general cluster computing system for Big Data. It provides
high-level APIs in Scala, Java, Python, and R, and an optimized engine that
supports general computation graphs for data analysis. It also supports a
rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and DataFrames,
MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing,
and Spark Streaming for stream processing.
You can find the latest Spark documentation, including a programming
guide, on the project web page
This README file only contains basic setup instructions.
Spark is built using Apache Maven
To build Spark and its example programs, run:
 You do not need to do this if you downloaded a pre-built package.
You can build Spark using more than one thread by using the -T option with Maven, see "Parallel builds in Maven 3"
For general development tips, including info on developing Spark using an IDE, see 
will run the Pi example locally.
You can set the MASTER environment variable when running examples to submit
examples to a cluster. 
"yarn" to run on YARN, and "local" to run
locally with one thread, or "local" to run locally with N threads. You
can also use an abbreviated class name if the class is in the `examples`
package. For instance: 
Many of the example programs print usage help if no params are given.
Spark uses the Hadoop core library to talk to HDFS and other Hadoop-supported
storage systems. Because the protocols have changed in different versions of
Hadoop, you must build Spark against the same version that your cluster runs.

Spark uses the Hadoop core library to talk to HDFS and other Hadoop-supported
storage systems. Because the protocols have changed in different versions of
Hadoop, you must build Spark against the same version that your cluster runs.
Please refer to the build documentation at

for detailed guidance on building for a particular distribution of Hadoop, including
building for particular Hive and Hive Thriftserver distributions.

Spark is a fast and general cluster computing system for Big Data. It provides
high-level APIs in Scala, Java, Python, and R, and an optimized engine that
supports general computation graphs for data analysis. It also supports a
rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and DataFrames,
MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing,
and Spark Streaming for stream processing.

Spark is built using Apache Maven
To build Spark and its example programs, run:
 You do not need to do this if you downloaded a pre-built package.
You can build Spark using more than one thread by using the -T option with Maven, see "Parallel builds in Maven 3"
For general development tips, including info on developing Spark using an IDE, see 
will run the Pi example locally.
You can set the MASTER environment variable when running examples to submit
examples to a cluster. 
"yarn" to run on YARN, and "local" to run
locally with one thread, or "local" to run locally with N threads. You
can also use an abbreviated class name if the class is in the `examples`
package. For instance: 
Many of the example programs print usage help if no params are given.
Spark uses the Hadoop core library to talk to HDFS and other Hadoop-supported
storage systems. Because the protocols have changed in different versions of
Hadoop, you must build Spark against the same version that your cluster runs.
Please refer to the build documentation at
Specifying the Hadoop Version and Enabling YARN
for detailed guidance on building for a particular distribution of Hadoop, including
building for particular Hive and Hive Thriftserver distributions.

Spark uses the Hadoop core library to talk to HDFS and other Hadoop-supported
storage systems. Because the protocols have changed in different versions of
Hadoop, you must build Spark against the same version that your cluster runs.
Please refer to the build documentation at

for detailed guidance on building for a particular distribution of Hadoop, including
building for particular Hive and Hive Thriftserver distributions.

Spark is a fast and general cluster computing system for Big Data. It provides
high-level APIs in Scala, Java, Python, and R, and an optimized engine that
supports general computation graphs for data analysis. It also supports a
rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and DataFrames,
MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing,
and Spark Streaming for stream processing.

Spark is built using Apache Maven
To build Spark and its example programs, run:
 You do not need to do this if you downloaded a pre-built package.
You can build Spark using more than one thread by using the -T option with Maven, see "Parallel builds in Maven 3"
For general development tips, including info on developing Spark using an IDE, see 
will run the Pi example locally.
You can set the MASTER environment variable when running examples to submit
examples to a cluster. 
"yarn" to run on YARN, and "local" to run
locally with one thread, or "local" to run locally with N threads. You
can also use an abbreviated class name if the class is in the `examples`
package. For instance: 
Many of the example programs print usage help if no params are given.
Spark uses the Hadoop core library to talk to HDFS and other Hadoop-supported
storage systems. Because the protocols have changed in different versions of
Hadoop, you must build Spark against the same version that your cluster runs.
Please refer to the build documentation at
Specifying the Hadoop Version and Enabling YARN
for detailed guidance on building for a particular distribution of Hadoop, including
building for particular Hive and Hive Thriftserver distributions.

Spark is a fast and general cluster computing system for Big Data. It provides

Spark uses the Hadoop core library to talk to HDFS and other Hadoop-supported
storage systems. Because the protocols have changed in different versions of
Hadoop, you must build Spark against the same version that your cluster runs.
Please refer to the build documentation at

for detailed guidance on building for a particular distribution of Hadoop, including
building for particular Hive and Hive Thriftserver distributions.

Spark is a fast and general cluster computing system for Big Data. It provides
high-level APIs in Scala, Java, Python, and R, and an optimized engine that
supports general computation graphs for data analysis. It also supports a
rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and DataFrames,
MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing,
and Spark Streaming for stream processing.

Spark is built using Apache Maven
To build Spark and its example programs, run:
 You do not need to do this if you downloaded a pre-built package.
You can build Spark using more than one thread by using the -T option with Maven, see "Parallel builds in Maven 3"
For general development tips, including info on developing Spark using an IDE, see 
will run the Pi example locally.
You can set the MASTER environment variable when running examples to submit
examples to a cluster. 
"yarn" to run on YARN, and "local" to run
locally with one thread, or "local" to run locally with N threads. You
can also use an abbreviated class name if the class is in the `examples`
package. For instance: 
Many of the example programs print usage help if no params are given.
Spark uses the Hadoop core library to talk to HDFS and other Hadoop-supported
storage systems. Because the protocols have changed in different versions of
Hadoop, you must build Spark against the same version that your cluster runs.
Please refer to the build documentation at
Specifying the Hadoop Version and Enabling YARN
for detailed guidance on building for a particular distribution of Hadoop, including
building for particular Hive and Hive Thriftserver distributions.

Spark uses the Hadoop core library to talk to HDFS and other Hadoop-supported
storage systems. Because the protocols have changed in different versions of
Hadoop, you must build Spark against the same version that your cluster runs.
Please refer to the build documentation at

for detailed guidance on building for a particular distribution of Hadoop, including
building for particular Hive and Hive Thriftserver distributions.

Spark is a fast and general cluster computing system for Big Data. It provides
high-level APIs in Scala, Java, Python, and R, and an optimized engine that
supports general computation graphs for data analysis. It also supports a
rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and DataFrames,
MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing,
and Spark Streaming for stream processing.

To build Spark and its example programs, run:
 You do not need to do this if you downloaded a pre-built package.
You can build Spark using more than one thread by using the -T option with Maven, see "Parallel builds in Maven 3"
For general development tips, including info on developing Spark using an IDE, see 
will run the Pi example locally.
You can set the MASTER environment variable when running examples to submit
examples to a cluster. 
"yarn" to run on YARN, and "local" to run
locally with one thread, or "local" to run locally with N threads. You
can also use an abbreviated class name if the class is in the `examples`
package. For instance: 
Many of the example programs print usage help if no params are given.
Spark uses the Hadoop core library to talk to HDFS and other Hadoop-supported
storage systems. Because the protocols have changed in different versions of
Hadoop, you must build Spark against the same version that your cluster runs.
Please refer to the build documentation at
Specifying the Hadoop Version and Enabling YARN
for detailed guidance on building for a particular distribution of Hadoop, including
building for particular Hive and Hive Thriftserver distributions.

Spark is a fast and general cluster computing system for Big Data. It provides
high-level APIs in Scala, Java, Python, and R, and an optimized engine that
supports general computation graphs for data analysis. It also supports a
rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and DataFrames,
MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing,
and Spark Streaming for stream processing.

Spark is a fast and general cluster computing system for Big Data. It provides
high-level APIs in Scala, Java, Python, and R, and an optimized engine that
supports general computation graphs for data analysis. It also supports a
rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and DataFrames,
MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing,
and Spark Streaming for stream processing.
You can find the latest Spark documentation, including a programming
guide, on the project web page
This README file only contains basic setup instructions.
Spark is built using Apache Maven
To build Spark and its example programs, run:
 You do not need to do this if you downloaded a pre-built package.
You can build Spark using more than one thread by using the -T option with Maven, see "Parallel builds in Maven 3"
For general development tips, including info on developing Spark using an IDE, see 
will run the Pi example locally.
You can set the MASTER environment variable when running examples to submit
examples to a cluster. 
"yarn" to run on YARN, and "local" to run
locally with one thread, or "local" to run locally with N threads. You
can also use an abbreviated class name if the class is in the `examples`
package. For instance: 
Many of the example programs print usage help if no params are given.
Spark uses the Hadoop core library to talk to HDFS and other Hadoop-supported
storage systems. Because the protocols have changed in different versions of
Hadoop, you must build Spark against the same version that your cluster runs.

Spark uses the Hadoop core library to talk to HDFS and other Hadoop-supported
storage systems. Because the protocols have changed in different versions of
Hadoop, you must build Spark against the same version that your cluster runs.
Please refer to the build documentation at
Specifying the Hadoop Version and Enabling YARN
for detailed guidance on building for a particular distribution of Hadoop, including
building for particular Hive and Hive Thriftserver distributions.

Spark is a fast and general cluster computing system for Big Data. It provides
high-level APIs in Scala, Java, Python, and R, and an optimized engine that
supports general computation graphs for data analysis. It also supports a
rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and DataFrames,
MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing,
and Spark Streaming for stream processing.

building for particular Hive and Hive Thriftserver distributions.

Spark is a fast and general cluster computing system for Big Data. It provides
high-level APIs in Scala, Java, Python, and R, and an optimized engine that
supports general computation graphs for data analysis. It also supports a
rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and DataFrames,
MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing,
and Spark Streaming for stream processing.
You can find the latest Spark documentation, including a programming
guide, on the project web page
This README file only contains basic setup instructions.
Spark is built using Apache Maven
To build Spark and its example programs, run:
 You do not need to do this if you downloaded a pre-built package.
You can build Spark using more than one thread by using the -T option with Maven, see "Parallel builds in Maven 3"
For general development tips, including info on developing Spark using an IDE, see 
will run the Pi example locally.
You can set the MASTER environment variable when running examples to submit
examples to a cluster. 
"yarn" to run on YARN, and "local" to run
locally with one thread, or "local" to run locally with N threads. You
can also use an abbreviated class name if the class is in the `examples`
package. For instance: 
Many of the example programs print usage help if no params are given.
Spark uses the Hadoop core library to talk to HDFS and other Hadoop-supported
storage systems. Because the protocols have changed in different versions of
Hadoop, you must build Spark against the same version that your cluster runs.

Spark uses the Hadoop core library to talk to HDFS and other Hadoop-supported
storage systems. Because the protocols have changed in different versions of
Hadoop, you must build Spark against the same version that your cluster runs.
Please refer to the build documentation at

for detailed guidance on building for a particular distribution of Hadoop, including
building for particular Hive and Hive Thriftserver distributions.

Spark is a fast and general cluster computing system for Big Data. It provides
high-level APIs in Scala, Java, Python, and R, and an optimized engine that
supports general computation graphs for data analysis. It also supports a
rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and DataFrames,
MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing,
and Spark Streaming for stream processing.

Spark is a fast and general cluster computing system for Big Data. It provides
high-level APIs in Scala, Java, Python, and R, and an optimized engine that
supports general computation graphs for data analysis. It also supports a
rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and DataFrames,
MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing,
and Spark Streaming for stream processing.
You can find the latest Spark documentation, including a programming
guide, on the project web page
This README file only contains basic setup instructions.
Spark is built using Apache Maven
To build Spark and its example programs, run:
 You do not need to do this if you downloaded a pre-built package.
You can build Spark using more than one thread by using the -T option with Maven, see "Parallel builds in Maven 3"
For general development tips, including info on developing Spark using an IDE, see 
will run the Pi example locally.
You can set the MASTER environment variable when running examples to submit
examples to a cluster. 
"yarn" to run on YARN, and "local" to run
locally with one thread, or "local" to run locally with N threads. You
can also use an abbreviated class name if the class is in the `examples`
package. For instance: 
Many of the example programs print usage help if no params are given.
Spark uses the Hadoop core library to talk to HDFS and other Hadoop-supported
storage systems. Because the protocols have changed in different versions of
Hadoop, you must build Spark against the same version that your cluster runs.

Spark uses the Hadoop core library to talk to HDFS and other Hadoop-supported
storage systems. Because the protocols have changed in different versions of
Hadoop, you must build Spark against the same version that your cluster runs.
Please refer to the build documentation at
Specifying the Hadoop Version and Enabling YARN
for detailed guidance on building for a particular distribution of Hadoop, including
building for particular Hive and Hive Thriftserver distributions.

Spark is a fast and general cluster computing system for Big Data. It provides
high-level APIs in Scala, Java, Python, and R, and an optimized engine that
supports general computation graphs for data analysis. It also supports a
rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and DataFrames,
MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing,
and Spark Streaming for stream processing.

building for particular Hive and Hive Thriftserver distributions.

Spark is a fast and general cluster computing system for Big Data. It provides
high-level APIs in Scala, Java, Python, and R, and an optimized engine that
supports general computation graphs for data analysis. It also supports a
rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and DataFrames,
MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing,
and Spark Streaming for stream processing.
You can find the latest Spark documentation, including a programming
guide, on the project web page
This README file only contains basic setup instructions.
Spark is built using Apache Maven
To build Spark and its example programs, run:
 You do not need to do this if you downloaded a pre-built package.
You can build Spark using more than one thread by using the -T option with Maven, see "Parallel builds in Maven 3"
For general development tips, including info on developing Spark using an IDE, see 
will run the Pi example locally.
You can set the MASTER environment variable when running examples to submit
examples to a cluster. 
"yarn" to run on YARN, and "local" to run
locally with one thread, or "local" to run locally with N threads. You
can also use an abbreviated class name if the class is in the `examples`
package. For instance: 
Many of the example programs print usage help if no params are given.
Spark uses the Hadoop core library to talk to HDFS and other Hadoop-supported
storage systems. Because the protocols have changed in different versions of
Hadoop, you must build Spark against the same version that your cluster runs.

Spark uses the Hadoop core library to talk to HDFS and other Hadoop-supported
storage systems. Because the protocols have changed in different versions of
Hadoop, you must build Spark against the same version that your cluster runs.
Please refer to the build documentation at

for detailed guidance on building for a particular distribution of Hadoop, including
building for particular Hive and Hive Thriftserver distributions.

Spark is a fast and general cluster computing system for Big Data. It provides
high-level APIs in Scala, Java, Python, and R, and an optimized engine that
supports general computation graphs for data analysis. It also supports a
rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and DataFrames,
MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing,
and Spark Streaming for stream processing.

Spark is built using Apache Maven
To build Spark and its example programs, run:
 You do not need to do this if you downloaded a pre-built package.
You can build Spark using more than one thread by using the -T option with Maven, see "Parallel builds in Maven 3"
For general development tips, including info on developing Spark using an IDE, see 
will run the Pi example locally.
You can set the MASTER environment variable when running examples to submit
examples to a cluster. 
"yarn" to run on YARN, and "local" to run
locally with one thread, or "local" to run locally with N threads. You
can also use an abbreviated class name if the class is in the `examples`
package. For instance: 
Many of the example programs print usage help if no params are given.
Spark uses the Hadoop core library to talk to HDFS and other Hadoop-supported
storage systems. Because the protocols have changed in different versions of
Hadoop, you must build Spark against the same version that your cluster runs.
Please refer to the build documentation at
Specifying the Hadoop Version and Enabling YARN
for detailed guidance on building for a particular distribution of Hadoop, including
building for particular Hive and Hive Thriftserver distributions.

Spark is a fast and general cluster computing system for Big Data. It provides
high-level APIs in Scala, Java, Python, and R, and an optimized engine that
supports general computation graphs for data analysis. It also supports a
rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and DataFrames,
MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing,
and Spark Streaming for stream processing.

Spark uses the Hadoop core library to talk to HDFS and other Hadoop-supported
storage systems. Because the protocols have changed in different versions of
Hadoop, you must build Spark against the same version that your cluster runs.
Please refer to the build documentation at

for detailed guidance on building for a particular distribution of Hadoop, including
building for particular Hive and Hive Thriftserver distributions.

Spark is a fast and general cluster computing system for Big Data. It provides
high-level APIs in Scala, Java, Python, and R, and an optimized engine that
supports general computation graphs for data analysis. It also supports a
rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and DataFrames,
MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing,
and Spark Streaming for stream processing.

Spark is built using Apache Maven
To build Spark and its example programs, run:
 You do not need to do this if you downloaded a pre-built package.
You can build Spark using more than one thread by using the -T option with Maven, see "Parallel builds in Maven 3"
For general development tips, including info on developing Spark using an IDE, see 
will run the Pi example locally.
You can set the MASTER environment variable when running examples to submit
examples to a cluster. 
"yarn" to run on YARN, and "local" to run
locally with one thread, or "local" to run locally with N threads. You
can also use an abbreviated class name if the class is in the `examples`
package. For instance: 
Many of the example programs print usage help if no params are given.
Spark uses the Hadoop core library to talk to HDFS and other Hadoop-supported
storage systems. Because the protocols have changed in different versions of
Hadoop, you must build Spark against the same version that your cluster runs.
Please refer to the build documentation at
Specifying the Hadoop Version and Enabling YARN
for detailed guidance on building for a particular distribution of Hadoop, including
building for particular Hive and Hive Thriftserver distributions.

Spark is a fast and general cluster computing system for Big Data. It provides
high-level APIs in Scala, Java, Python, and R, and an optimized engine that
supports general computation graphs for data analysis. It also supports a
rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and DataFrames,
MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing,
and Spark Streaming for stream processing.

Spark is a fast and general cluster computing system for Big Data. It provides
high-level APIs in Scala, Java, Python, and R, and an optimized engine that
supports general computation graphs for data analysis. It also supports a
rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and DataFrames,
MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing,
and Spark Streaming for stream processing.
You can find the latest Spark documentation, including a programming
guide, on the project web page
This README file only contains basic setup instructions.
Spark is built using Apache Maven
To build Spark and its example programs, run:
 You do not need to do this if you downloaded a pre-built package.
You can build Spark using more than one thread by using the -T option with Maven, see "Parallel builds in Maven 3"
For general development tips, including info on developing Spark using an IDE, see 
will run the Pi example locally.
You can set the MASTER environment variable when running examples to submit
examples to a cluster. 
"yarn" to run on YARN, and "local" to run
locally with one thread, or "local" to run locally with N threads. You
can also use an abbreviated class name if the class is in the `examples`
package. For instance: 
Many of the example programs print usage help if no params are given.

Many of the example programs print usage help if no params are given.
Spark uses the Hadoop core library to talk to HDFS and other Hadoop-supported
storage systems. Because the protocols have changed in different versions of
Hadoop, you must build Spark against the same version that your cluster runs.
Please refer to the build documentation at
Specifying the Hadoop Version and Enabling YARN
for detailed guidance on building for a particular distribution of Hadoop, including
building for particular Hive and Hive Thriftserver distributions.

Spark is a fast and general cluster computing system for Big Data. It provides
high-level APIs in Scala, Java, Python, and R, and an optimized engine that
supports general computation graphs for data analysis. It also supports a
rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and DataFrames,
MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing,
and Spark Streaming for stream processing.

Spark uses the Hadoop core library to talk to HDFS and other Hadoop-supported
storage systems. Because the protocols have changed in different versions of
Hadoop, you must build Spark against the same version that your cluster runs.
Please refer to the build documentation at

for detailed guidance on building for a particular distribution of Hadoop, including
building for particular Hive and Hive Thriftserver distributions.

Spark is a fast and general cluster computing system for Big Data. It provides
high-level APIs in Scala, Java, Python, and R, and an optimized engine that
supports general computation graphs for data analysis. It also supports a
rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and DataFrames,
MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing,
and Spark Streaming for stream processing.

 You do not need to do this if you downloaded a pre-built package.
You can build Spark using more than one thread by using the -T option with Maven, see "Parallel builds in Maven 3"
For general development tips, including info on developing Spark using an IDE, see 
will run the Pi example locally.
You can set the MASTER environment variable when running examples to submit
examples to a cluster. 
"yarn" to run on YARN, and "local" to run
locally with one thread, or "local" to run locally with N threads. You
can also use an abbreviated class name if the class is in the `examples`
package. For instance: 
Many of the example programs print usage help if no params are given.
Spark uses the Hadoop core library to talk to HDFS and other Hadoop-supported
storage systems. Because the protocols have changed in different versions of
Hadoop, you must build Spark against the same version that your cluster runs.
Please refer to the build documentation at
Specifying the Hadoop Version and Enabling YARN
for detailed guidance on building for a particular distribution of Hadoop, including
building for particular Hive and Hive Thriftserver distributions.

Spark is a fast and general cluster computing system for Big Data. It provides
high-level APIs in Scala, Java, Python, and R, and an optimized engine that
supports general computation graphs for data analysis. It also supports a
rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and DataFrames,
MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing,
and Spark Streaming for stream processing.

building for particular Hive and Hive Thriftserver distributions.

Spark is a fast and general cluster computing system for Big Data. It provides
high-level APIs in Scala, Java, Python, and R, and an optimized engine that
supports general computation graphs for data analysis. It also supports a
rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and DataFrames,
MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing,
and Spark Streaming for stream processing.
You can find the latest Spark documentation, including a programming
guide, on the project web page
This README file only contains basic setup instructions.
Spark is built using Apache Maven
To build Spark and its example programs, run:
 You do not need to do this if you downloaded a pre-built package.
You can build Spark using more than one thread by using the -T option with Maven, see "Parallel builds in Maven 3"
For general development tips, including info on developing Spark using an IDE, see 
will run the Pi example locally.
You can set the MASTER environment variable when running examples to submit
examples to a cluster. 
"yarn" to run on YARN, and "local" to run
locally with one thread, or "local" to run locally with N threads. You
can also use an abbreviated class name if the class is in the `examples`
package. For instance: 
Many of the example programs print usage help if no params are given.
Spark uses the Hadoop core library to talk to HDFS and other Hadoop-supported
storage systems. Because the protocols have changed in different versions of
Hadoop, you must build Spark against the same version that your cluster runs.

Spark uses the Hadoop core library to talk to HDFS and other Hadoop-supported
storage systems. Because the protocols have changed in different versions of
Hadoop, you must build Spark against the same version that your cluster runs.
Please refer to the build documentation at

for detailed guidance on building for a particular distribution of Hadoop, including
building for particular Hive and Hive Thriftserver distributions.

Spark is a fast and general cluster computing system for Big Data. It provides
high-level APIs in Scala, Java, Python, and R, and an optimized engine that
supports general computation graphs for data analysis. It also supports a
rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and DataFrames,
MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing,
and Spark Streaming for stream processing.

Spark is built using Apache Maven
To build Spark and its example programs, run:
 You do not need to do this if you downloaded a pre-built package.
You can build Spark using more than one thread by using the -T option with Maven, see "Parallel builds in Maven 3"
For general development tips, including info on developing Spark using an IDE, see 
will run the Pi example locally.
You can set the MASTER environment variable when running examples to submit
examples to a cluster. 
"yarn" to run on YARN, and "local" to run
locally with one thread, or "local" to run locally with N threads. You
can also use an abbreviated class name if the class is in the `examples`
package. For instance: 
Many of the example programs print usage help if no params are given.
Spark uses the Hadoop core library to talk to HDFS and other Hadoop-supported
storage systems. Because the protocols have changed in different versions of
Hadoop, you must build Spark against the same version that your cluster runs.
Please refer to the build documentation at
Specifying the Hadoop Version and Enabling YARN
for detailed guidance on building for a particular distribution of Hadoop, including
building for particular Hive and Hive Thriftserver distributions.

Spark is a fast and general cluster computing system for Big Data. It provides
high-level APIs in Scala, Java, Python, and R, and an optimized engine that
supports general computation graphs for data analysis. It also supports a
rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and DataFrames,
MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing,
and Spark Streaming for stream processing.

Spark uses the Hadoop core library to talk to HDFS and other Hadoop-supported
storage systems. Because the protocols have changed in different versions of
Hadoop, you must build Spark against the same version that your cluster runs.
Please refer to the build documentation at

for detailed guidance on building for a particular distribution of Hadoop, including
building for particular Hive and Hive Thriftserver distributions.

Spark is a fast and general cluster computing system for Big Data. It provides
high-level APIs in Scala, Java, Python, and R, and an optimized engine that
supports general computation graphs for data analysis. It also supports a
rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and DataFrames,
MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing,
and Spark Streaming for stream processing.

Spark is built using Apache Maven
To build Spark and its example programs, run:
 You do not need to do this if you downloaded a pre-built package.
You can build Spark using more than one thread by using the -T option with Maven, see "Parallel builds in Maven 3"
For general development tips, including info on developing Spark using an IDE, see 
will run the Pi example locally.
You can set the MASTER environment variable when running examples to submit
examples to a cluster. 
"yarn" to run on YARN, and "local" to run
locally with one thread, or "local" to run locally with N threads. You
can also use an abbreviated class name if the class is in the `examples`
package. For instance: 
Many of the example programs print usage help if no params are given.
Spark uses the Hadoop core library to talk to HDFS and other Hadoop-supported
storage systems. Because the protocols have changed in different versions of
Hadoop, you must build Spark against the same version that your cluster runs.
Please refer to the build documentation at
Specifying the Hadoop Version and Enabling YARN
for detailed guidance on building for a particular distribution of Hadoop, including
building for particular Hive and Hive Thriftserver distributions.

Spark is a fast and general cluster computing system for Big Data. It provides
high-level APIs in Scala, Java, Python, and R, and an optimized engine that
supports general computation graphs for data analysis. It also supports a
rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and DataFrames,
MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing,
and Spark Streaming for stream processing.

Spark is a fast and general cluster computing system for Big Data. It provides
high-level APIs in Scala, Java, Python, and R, and an optimized engine that
supports general computation graphs for data analysis. It also supports a
rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and DataFrames,
MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing,
and Spark Streaming for stream processing.

You can set the MASTER environment variable when running examples to submit
examples to a cluster. 
"yarn" to run on YARN, and "local" to run
locally with one thread, or "local" to run locally with N threads. You
can also use an abbreviated class name if the class is in the `examples`
package. For instance: 
Many of the example programs print usage help if no params are given.

Spark is built using Apache Maven
To build Spark and its example programs, run:
 You do not need to do this if you downloaded a pre-built package.
You can build Spark using more than one thread by using the -T option with Maven, see "Parallel builds in Maven 3"
For general development tips, including info on developing Spark using an IDE, see 
will run the Pi example locally.
You can set the MASTER environment variable when running examples to submit
examples to a cluster. 
"yarn" to run on YARN, and "local" to run
locally with one thread, or "local" to run locally with N threads. You
can also use an abbreviated class name if the class is in the `examples`
package. For instance: 
Many of the example programs print usage help if no params are given.
Spark uses the Hadoop core library to talk to HDFS and other Hadoop-supported
storage systems. Because the protocols have changed in different versions of
Hadoop, you must build Spark against the same version that your cluster runs.
Please refer to the build documentation at
Specifying the Hadoop Version and Enabling YARN
for detailed guidance on building for a particular distribution of Hadoop, including
building for particular Hive and Hive Thriftserver distributions.

Spark is a fast and general cluster computing system for Big Data. It provides
high-level APIs in Scala, Java, Python, and R, and an optimized engine that
supports general computation graphs for data analysis. It also supports a
rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and DataFrames,
MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing,
and Spark Streaming for stream processing.

storage systems. Because the protocols have changed in different versions of
Hadoop, you must build Spark against the same version that your cluster runs.
Please refer to the build documentation at
Specifying the Hadoop Version and Enabling YARN
for detailed guidance on building for a particular distribution of Hadoop, including
building for particular Hive and Hive Thriftserver distributions.

Spark is a fast and general cluster computing system for Big Data. It provides
high-level APIs in Scala, Java, Python, and R, and an optimized engine that
supports general computation graphs for data analysis. It also supports a
rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and DataFrames,
MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing,
and Spark Streaming for stream processing.

 You do not need to do this if you downloaded a pre-built package.
You can build Spark using more than one thread by using the -T option with Maven, see "Parallel builds in Maven 3"
For general development tips, including info on developing Spark using an IDE, see 
will run the Pi example locally.
You can set the MASTER environment variable when running examples to submit
examples to a cluster. 
"yarn" to run on YARN, and "local" to run
locally with one thread, or "local" to run locally with N threads. You
can also use an abbreviated class name if the class is in the `examples`
package. For instance: 
Many of the example programs print usage help if no params are given.
Spark uses the Hadoop core library to talk to HDFS and other Hadoop-supported
storage systems. Because the protocols have changed in different versions of
Hadoop, you must build Spark against the same version that your cluster runs.
Please refer to the build documentation at
Specifying the Hadoop Version and Enabling YARN
for detailed guidance on building for a particular distribution of Hadoop, including
building for particular Hive and Hive Thriftserver distributions.

Spark is a fast and general cluster computing system for Big Data. It provides
high-level APIs in Scala, Java, Python, and R, and an optimized engine that
supports general computation graphs for data analysis. It also supports a
rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and DataFrames,
MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing,
and Spark Streaming for stream processing.

high-level APIs in Scala, Java, Python, and R, and an optimized engine that
supports general computation graphs for data analysis. It also supports a
rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and DataFrames,
MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing,
and Spark Streaming for stream processing.

guide, on the project web page
This README file only contains basic setup instructions.
Spark is built using Apache Maven
To build Spark and its example programs, run:
 You do not need to do this if you downloaded a pre-built package.
You can build Spark using more than one thread by using the -T option with Maven, see "Parallel builds in Maven 3"
For general development tips, including info on developing Spark using an IDE, see 
will run the Pi example locally.
You can set the MASTER environment variable when running examples to submit
examples to a cluster. 
"yarn" to run on YARN, and "local" to run
locally with one thread, or "local" to run locally with N threads. You
can also use an abbreviated class name if the class is in the `examples`
package. For instance: 
Many of the example programs print usage help if no params are given.
Spark uses the Hadoop core library to talk to HDFS and other Hadoop-supported
storage systems. Because the protocols have changed in different versions of
Hadoop, you must build Spark against the same version that your cluster runs.
Please refer to the build documentation at

Spark uses the Hadoop core library to talk to HDFS and other Hadoop-supported
storage systems. Because the protocols have changed in different versions of
Hadoop, you must build Spark against the same version that your cluster runs.
Please refer to the build documentation at

for detailed guidance on building for a particular distribution of Hadoop, including
building for particular Hive and Hive Thriftserver distributions.

Spark is a fast and general cluster computing system for Big Data. It provides
high-level APIs in Scala, Java, Python, and R, and an optimized engine that
supports general computation graphs for data analysis. It also supports a
rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and DataFrames,
MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing,
and Spark Streaming for stream processing.

Spark is built using Apache Maven
To build Spark and its example programs, run:
 You do not need to do this if you downloaded a pre-built package.
You can build Spark using more than one thread by using the -T option with Maven, see "Parallel builds in Maven 3"
For general development tips, including info on developing Spark using an IDE, see 
will run the Pi example locally.
You can set the MASTER environment variable when running examples to submit
examples to a cluster. 
"yarn" to run on YARN, and "local" to run
locally with one thread, or "local" to run locally with N threads. You
can also use an abbreviated class name if the class is in the `examples`
package. For instance: 
Many of the example programs print usage help if no params are given.
Spark uses the Hadoop core library to talk to HDFS and other Hadoop-supported
storage systems. Because the protocols have changed in different versions of
Hadoop, you must build Spark against the same version that your cluster runs.
Please refer to the build documentation at
Specifying the Hadoop Version and Enabling YARN
for detailed guidance on building for a particular distribution of Hadoop, including
building for particular Hive and Hive Thriftserver distributions.

Spark is a fast and general cluster computing system for Big Data. It provides
high-level APIs in Scala, Java, Python, and R, and an optimized engine that
supports general computation graphs for data analysis. It also supports a

Spark uses the Hadoop core library to talk to HDFS and other Hadoop-supported
storage systems. Because the protocols have changed in different versions of
Hadoop, you must build Spark against the same version that your cluster runs.
Please refer to the build documentation at

for detailed guidance on building for a particular distribution of Hadoop, including
building for particular Hive and Hive Thriftserver distributions.

Spark is a fast and general cluster computing system for Big Data. It provides
high-level APIs in Scala, Java, Python, and R, and an optimized engine that
supports general computation graphs for data analysis. It also supports a
rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and DataFrames,
MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing,
and Spark Streaming for stream processing.

Spark is built using Apache Maven
To build Spark and its example programs, run:
 You do not need to do this if you downloaded a pre-built package.
You can build Spark using more than one thread by using the -T option with Maven, see "Parallel builds in Maven 3"
For general development tips, including info on developing Spark using an IDE, see 
will run the Pi example locally.
You can set the MASTER environment variable when running examples to submit
examples to a cluster. 
"yarn" to run on YARN, and "local" to run
locally with one thread, or "local" to run locally with N threads. You
can also use an abbreviated class name if the class is in the `examples`
package. For instance: 
Many of the example programs print usage help if no params are given.
Spark uses the Hadoop core library to talk to HDFS and other Hadoop-supported
storage systems. Because the protocols have changed in different versions of
Hadoop, you must build Spark against the same version that your cluster runs.
Please refer to the build documentation at
Specifying the Hadoop Version and Enabling YARN
for detailed guidance on building for a particular distribution of Hadoop, including
building for particular Hive and Hive Thriftserver distributions.

Spark is a fast and general cluster computing system for Big Data. It provides
high-level APIs in Scala, Java, Python, and R, and an optimized engine that
supports general computation graphs for data analysis. It also supports a
rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and DataFrames,
MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing,
and Spark Streaming for stream processing.

Spark uses the Hadoop core library to talk to HDFS and other Hadoop-supported
storage systems. Because the protocols have changed in different versions of
Hadoop, you must build Spark against the same version that your cluster runs.
Please refer to the build documentation at

for detailed guidance on building for a particular distribution of Hadoop, including
building for particular Hive and Hive Thriftserver distributions.

Spark is a fast and general cluster computing system for Big Data. It provides
high-level APIs in Scala, Java, Python, and R, and an optimized engine that
supports general computation graphs for data analysis. It also supports a
rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and DataFrames,
MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing,
and Spark Streaming for stream processing.

Spark is built using Apache Maven
To build Spark and its example programs, run:
 You do not need to do this if you downloaded a pre-built package.
You can build Spark using more than one thread by using the -T option with Maven, see "Parallel builds in Maven 3"
For general development tips, including info on developing Spark using an IDE, see 
will run the Pi example locally.
You can set the MASTER environment variable when running examples to submit
examples to a cluster. 
"yarn" to run on YARN, and "local" to run
locally with one thread, or "local" to run locally with N threads. You
can also use an abbreviated class name if the class is in the `examples`
package. For instance: 
Many of the example programs print usage help if no params are given.
Spark uses the Hadoop core library to talk to HDFS and other Hadoop-supported
storage systems. Because the protocols have changed in different versions of
Hadoop, you must build Spark against the same version that your cluster runs.
Please refer to the build documentation at
Specifying the Hadoop Version and Enabling YARN
for detailed guidance on building for a particular distribution of Hadoop, including
building for particular Hive and Hive Thriftserver distributions.

Spark is a fast and general cluster computing system for Big Data. It provides
high-level APIs in Scala, Java, Python, and R, and an optimized engine that
supports general computation graphs for data analysis. It also supports a
rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and DataFrames,
MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing,
and Spark Streaming for stream processing.

Spark uses the Hadoop core library to talk to HDFS and other Hadoop-supported
storage systems. Because the protocols have changed in different versions of
Hadoop, you must build Spark against the same version that your cluster runs.
Please refer to the build documentation at

for detailed guidance on building for a particular distribution of Hadoop, including
building for particular Hive and Hive Thriftserver distributions.

Spark is a fast and general cluster computing system for Big Data. It provides
high-level APIs in Scala, Java, Python, and R, and an optimized engine that
supports general computation graphs for data analysis. It also supports a
rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and DataFrames,
MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing,
and Spark Streaming for stream processing.

Spark is built using Apache Maven
To build Spark and its example programs, run:
 You do not need to do this if you downloaded a pre-built package.
You can build Spark using more than one thread by using the -T option with Maven, see "Parallel builds in Maven 3"
For general development tips, including info on developing Spark using an IDE, see 
will run the Pi example locally.
You can set the MASTER environment variable when running examples to submit
examples to a cluster. 
"yarn" to run on YARN, and "local" to run
locally with one thread, or "local" to run locally with N threads. You
can also use an abbreviated class name if the class is in the `examples`
package. For instance: 
Many of the example programs print usage help if no params are given.
Spark uses the Hadoop core library to talk to HDFS and other Hadoop-supported
storage systems. Because the protocols have changed in different versions of
Hadoop, you must build Spark against the same version that your cluster runs.
Please refer to the build documentation at
Specifying the Hadoop Version and Enabling YARN
for detailed guidance on building for a particular distribution of Hadoop, including
building for particular Hive and Hive Thriftserver distributions.

Spark is a fast and general cluster computing system for Big Data. It provides
high-level APIs in Scala, Java, Python, and R, and an optimized engine that
supports general computation graphs for data analysis. It also supports a
rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and DataFrames,
MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing,
and Spark Streaming for stream processing.

Spark is a fast and general cluster computing system for Big Data. It provides
high-level APIs in Scala, Java, Python, and R, and an optimized engine that
supports general computation graphs for data analysis. It also supports a
rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and DataFrames,
MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing,
and Spark Streaming for stream processing.
You can find the latest Spark documentation, including a programming
guide, on the project web page
This README file only contains basic setup instructions.
Spark is built using Apache Maven
To build Spark and its example programs, run:
 You do not need to do this if you downloaded a pre-built package.
You can build Spark using more than one thread by using the -T option with Maven, see "Parallel builds in Maven 3"
For general development tips, including info on developing Spark using an IDE, see 
will run the Pi example locally.
You can set the MASTER environment variable when running examples to submit
examples to a cluster. 
"yarn" to run on YARN, and "local" to run
locally with one thread, or "local" to run locally with N threads. You
can also use an abbreviated class name if the class is in the `examples`
package. For instance: 
Many of the example programs print usage help if no params are given.
Spark uses the Hadoop core library to talk to HDFS and other Hadoop-supported
storage systems. Because the protocols have changed in different versions of
Hadoop, you must build Spark against the same version that your cluster runs.

Spark uses the Hadoop core library to talk to HDFS and other Hadoop-supported
storage systems. Because the protocols have changed in different versions of
Hadoop, you must build Spark against the same version that your cluster runs.
Please refer to the build documentation at

for detailed guidance on building for a particular distribution of Hadoop, including
building for particular Hive and Hive Thriftserver distributions.

Spark is a fast and general cluster computing system for Big Data. It provides
high-level APIs in Scala, Java, Python, and R, and an optimized engine that
supports general computation graphs for data analysis. It also supports a
rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and DataFrames,
MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing,
and Spark Streaming for stream processing.

Spark is built using Apache Maven
To build Spark and its example programs, run:
 You do not need to do this if you downloaded a pre-built package.
You can build Spark using more than one thread by using the -T option with Maven, see "Parallel builds in Maven 3"
For general development tips, including info on developing Spark using an IDE, see 
will run the Pi example locally.
You can set the MASTER environment variable when running examples to submit
examples to a cluster. 
"yarn" to run on YARN, and "local" to run
locally with one thread, or "local" to run locally with N threads. You
can also use an abbreviated class name if the class is in the `examples`
package. For instance: 
Many of the example programs print usage help if no params are given.
Spark uses the Hadoop core library to talk to HDFS and other Hadoop-supported
storage systems. Because the protocols have changed in different versions of
Hadoop, you must build Spark against the same version that your cluster runs.
Please refer to the build documentation at
Specifying the Hadoop Version and Enabling YARN
for detailed guidance on building for a particular distribution of Hadoop, including
building for particular Hive and Hive Thriftserver distributions.

Spark uses the Hadoop core library to talk to HDFS and other Hadoop-supported
storage systems. Because the protocols have changed in different versions of
Hadoop, you must build Spark against the same version that your cluster runs.
Please refer to the build documentation at

for detailed guidance on building for a particular distribution of Hadoop, including
building for particular Hive and Hive Thriftserver distributions.

Spark is a fast and general cluster computing system for Big Data. It provides
high-level APIs in Scala, Java, Python, and R, and an optimized engine that
supports general computation graphs for data analysis. It also supports a
rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and DataFrames,
MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing,
and Spark Streaming for stream processing.

Spark is built using Apache Maven
To build Spark and its example programs, run:
 You do not need to do this if you downloaded a pre-built package.
You can build Spark using more than one thread by using the -T option with Maven, see "Parallel builds in Maven 3"
For general development tips, including info on developing Spark using an IDE, see 
will run the Pi example locally.
You can set the MASTER environment variable when running examples to submit
examples to a cluster. 
"yarn" to run on YARN, and "local" to run
locally with one thread, or "local" to run locally with N threads. You
can also use an abbreviated class name if the class is in the `examples`
package. For instance: 
Many of the example programs print usage help if no params are given.
Spark uses the Hadoop core library to talk to HDFS and other Hadoop-supported
storage systems. Because the protocols have changed in different versions of
Hadoop, you must build Spark against the same version that your cluster runs.
Please refer to the build documentation at
Specifying the Hadoop Version and Enabling YARN
for detailed guidance on building for a particular distribution of Hadoop, including
building for particular Hive and Hive Thriftserver distributions.

Spark is a fast and general cluster computing system for Big Data. It provides
high-level APIs in Scala, Java, Python, and R, and an optimized engine that
supports general computation graphs for data analysis. It also supports a

Spark uses the Hadoop core library to talk to HDFS and other Hadoop-supported
storage systems. Because the protocols have changed in different versions of
Hadoop, you must build Spark against the same version that your cluster runs.
Please refer to the build documentation at

for detailed guidance on building for a particular distribution of Hadoop, including
building for particular Hive and Hive Thriftserver distributions.

Spark is a fast and general cluster computing system for Big Data. It provides
high-level APIs in Scala, Java, Python, and R, and an optimized engine that
supports general computation graphs for data analysis. It also supports a
rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and DataFrames,
MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing,
and Spark Streaming for stream processing.

Spark is built using Apache Maven
To build Spark and its example programs, run:
 You do not need to do this if you downloaded a pre-built package.
You can build Spark using more than one thread by using the -T option with Maven, see "Parallel builds in Maven 3"
For general development tips, including info on developing Spark using an IDE, see 
will run the Pi example locally.
You can set the MASTER environment variable when running examples to submit
examples to a cluster. 
"yarn" to run on YARN, and "local" to run
locally with one thread, or "local" to run locally with N threads. You
can also use an abbreviated class name if the class is in the `examples`
package. For instance: 
Many of the example programs print usage help if no params are given.
Spark uses the Hadoop core library to talk to HDFS and other Hadoop-supported
storage systems. Because the protocols have changed in different versions of
Hadoop, you must build Spark against the same version that your cluster runs.
Please refer to the build documentation at
Specifying the Hadoop Version and Enabling YARN
for detailed guidance on building for a particular distribution of Hadoop, including
building for particular Hive and Hive Thriftserver distributions.

Spark uses the Hadoop core library to talk to HDFS and other Hadoop-supported
storage systems. Because the protocols have changed in different versions of
Hadoop, you must build Spark against the same version that your cluster runs.
Please refer to the build documentation at

for detailed guidance on building for a particular distribution of Hadoop, including
building for particular Hive and Hive Thriftserver distributions.

Spark is a fast and general cluster computing system for Big Data. It provides
high-level APIs in Scala, Java, Python, and R, and an optimized engine that
supports general computation graphs for data analysis. It also supports a
rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and DataFrames,
MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing,
and Spark Streaming for stream processing.

To build Spark and its example programs, run:
 You do not need to do this if you downloaded a pre-built package.
You can build Spark using more than one thread by using the -T option with Maven, see "Parallel builds in Maven 3"
For general development tips, including info on developing Spark using an IDE, see 
will run the Pi example locally.
You can set the MASTER environment variable when running examples to submit
examples to a cluster. 
"yarn" to run on YARN, and "local" to run
locally with one thread, or "local" to run locally with N threads. You
can also use an abbreviated class name if the class is in the `examples`
package. For instance: 
Many of the example programs print usage help if no params are given.
Spark uses the Hadoop core library to talk to HDFS and other Hadoop-supported
storage systems. Because the protocols have changed in different versions of
Hadoop, you must build Spark against the same version that your cluster runs.
Please refer to the build documentation at
Specifying the Hadoop Version and Enabling YARN
for detailed guidance on building for a particular distribution of Hadoop, including
building for particular Hive and Hive Thriftserver distributions.

Spark is a fast and general cluster computing system for Big Data. It provides
high-level APIs in Scala, Java, Python, and R, and an optimized engine that
supports general computation graphs for data analysis. It also supports a
rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and DataFrames,
MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing,
and Spark Streaming for stream processing.

Spark is a fast and general cluster computing system for Big Data. It provides
high-level APIs in Scala, Java, Python, and R, and an optimized engine that
supports general computation graphs for data analysis. It also supports a
rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and DataFrames,
MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing,
and Spark Streaming for stream processing.
You can find the latest Spark documentation, including a programming
guide, on the project web page
This README file only contains basic setup instructions.
Spark is built using Apache Maven
To build Spark and its example programs, run:
 You do not need to do this if you downloaded a pre-built package.
You can build Spark using more than one thread by using the -T option with Maven, see "Parallel builds in Maven 3"
For general development tips, including info on developing Spark using an IDE, see 
will run the Pi example locally.
You can set the MASTER environment variable when running examples to submit
examples to a cluster. 
"yarn" to run on YARN, and "local" to run
locally with one thread, or "local" to run locally with N threads. You
can also use an abbreviated class name if the class is in the `examples`
package. For instance: 
Many of the example programs print usage help if no params are given.
Spark uses the Hadoop core library to talk to HDFS and other Hadoop-supported
storage systems. Because the protocols have changed in different versions of
Hadoop, you must build Spark against the same version that your cluster runs.

Spark uses the Hadoop core library to talk to HDFS and other Hadoop-supported
storage systems. Because the protocols have changed in different versions of
Hadoop, you must build Spark against the same version that your cluster runs.
Please refer to the build documentation at
Specifying the Hadoop Version and Enabling YARN
for detailed guidance on building for a particular distribution of Hadoop, including
building for particular Hive and Hive Thriftserver distributions.

Spark is a fast and general cluster computing system for Big Data. It provides
high-level APIs in Scala, Java, Python, and R, and an optimized engine that
supports general computation graphs for data analysis. It also supports a
rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and DataFrames,
MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing,
and Spark Streaming for stream processing.

building for particular Hive and Hive Thriftserver distributions.

Spark is a fast and general cluster computing system for Big Data. It provides
high-level APIs in Scala, Java, Python, and R, and an optimized engine that
supports general computation graphs for data analysis. It also supports a
rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and DataFrames,
MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing,
and Spark Streaming for stream processing.
You can find the latest Spark documentation, including a programming
guide, on the project web page
This README file only contains basic setup instructions.
Spark is built using Apache Maven
To build Spark and its example programs, run:
 You do not need to do this if you downloaded a pre-built package.
You can build Spark using more than one thread by using the -T option with Maven, see "Parallel builds in Maven 3"
For general development tips, including info on developing Spark using an IDE, see 
will run the Pi example locally.
You can set the MASTER environment variable when running examples to submit
examples to a cluster. 
"yarn" to run on YARN, and "local" to run
locally with one thread, or "local" to run locally with N threads. You
can also use an abbreviated class name if the class is in the `examples`
package. For instance: 
Many of the example programs print usage help if no params are given.
Spark uses the Hadoop core library to talk to HDFS and other Hadoop-supported
storage systems. Because the protocols have changed in different versions of
Hadoop, you must build Spark against the same version that your cluster runs.

Spark uses the Hadoop core library to talk to HDFS and other Hadoop-supported
storage systems. Because the protocols have changed in different versions of
Hadoop, you must build Spark against the same version that your cluster runs.
Please refer to the build documentation at

for detailed guidance on building for a particular distribution of Hadoop, including
building for particular Hive and Hive Thriftserver distributions.

Spark is a fast and general cluster computing system for Big Data. It provides
high-level APIs in Scala, Java, Python, and R, and an optimized engine that
supports general computation graphs for data analysis. It also supports a
rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and DataFrames,
MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing,
and Spark Streaming for stream processing.

Spark is a fast and general cluster computing system for Big Data. It provides
high-level APIs in Scala, Java, Python, and R, and an optimized engine that
supports general computation graphs for data analysis. It also supports a
rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and DataFrames,
MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing,
and Spark Streaming for stream processing.
You can find the latest Spark documentation, including a programming
guide, on the project web page
This README file only contains basic setup instructions.
Spark is built using Apache Maven
To build Spark and its example programs, run:
 You do not need to do this if you downloaded a pre-built package.
You can build Spark using more than one thread by using the -T option with Maven, see "Parallel builds in Maven 3"
For general development tips, including info on developing Spark using an IDE, see 
will run the Pi example locally.
You can set the MASTER environment variable when running examples to submit
examples to a cluster. 
"yarn" to run on YARN, and "local" to run
locally with one thread, or "local" to run locally with N threads. You
can also use an abbreviated class name if the class is in the `examples`
package. For instance: 
Many of the example programs print usage help if no params are given.
Spark uses the Hadoop core library to talk to HDFS and other Hadoop-supported
storage systems. Because the protocols have changed in different versions of
Hadoop, you must build Spark against the same version that your cluster runs.

Spark uses the Hadoop core library to talk to HDFS and other Hadoop-supported
storage systems. Because the protocols have changed in different versions of
Hadoop, you must build Spark against the same version that your cluster runs.
Please refer to the build documentation at
Specifying the Hadoop Version and Enabling YARN
for detailed guidance on building for a particular distribution of Hadoop, including
building for particular Hive and Hive Thriftserver distributions.

Spark is a fast and general cluster computing system for Big Data. It provides
high-level APIs in Scala, Java, Python, and R, and an optimized engine that
supports general computation graphs for data analysis. It also supports a
rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and DataFrames,
MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing,
and Spark Streaming for stream processing.

building for particular Hive and Hive Thriftserver distributions.

Spark is a fast and general cluster computing system for Big Data. It provides
high-level APIs in Scala, Java, Python, and R, and an optimized engine that
supports general computation graphs for data analysis. It also supports a
rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and DataFrames,
MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing,
and Spark Streaming for stream processing.
You can find the latest Spark documentation, including a programming
guide, on the project web page
This README file only contains basic setup instructions.
Spark is built using Apache Maven
To build Spark and its example programs, run:
 You do not need to do this if you downloaded a pre-built package.
You can build Spark using more than one thread by using the -T option with Maven, see "Parallel builds in Maven 3"
For general development tips, including info on developing Spark using an IDE, see 
will run the Pi example locally.
You can set the MASTER environment variable when running examples to submit
examples to a cluster. 
"yarn" to run on YARN, and "local" to run
locally with one thread, or "local" to run locally with N threads. You
can also use an abbreviated class name if the class is in the `examples`
package. For instance: 
Many of the example programs print usage help if no params are given.
Spark uses the Hadoop core library to talk to HDFS and other Hadoop-supported
storage systems. Because the protocols have changed in different versions of
Hadoop, you must build Spark against the same version that your cluster runs.

Spark uses the Hadoop core library to talk to HDFS and other Hadoop-supported
storage systems. Because the protocols have changed in different versions of
Hadoop, you must build Spark against the same version that your cluster runs.
Please refer to the build documentation at

for detailed guidance on building for a particular distribution of Hadoop, including
building for particular Hive and Hive Thriftserver distributions.

Spark is a fast and general cluster computing system for Big Data. It provides
high-level APIs in Scala, Java, Python, and R, and an optimized engine that
supports general computation graphs for data analysis. It also supports a
rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and DataFrames,
MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing,
and Spark Streaming for stream processing.

Spark is built using Apache Maven
To build Spark and its example programs, run:
 You do not need to do this if you downloaded a pre-built package.
You can build Spark using more than one thread by using the -T option with Maven, see "Parallel builds in Maven 3"
For general development tips, including info on developing Spark using an IDE, see 
will run the Pi example locally.
You can set the MASTER environment variable when running examples to submit
examples to a cluster. 
"yarn" to run on YARN, and "local" to run
locally with one thread, or "local" to run locally with N threads. You
can also use an abbreviated class name if the class is in the `examples`
package. For instance: 
Many of the example programs print usage help if no params are given.
Spark uses the Hadoop core library to talk to HDFS and other Hadoop-supported
storage systems. Because the protocols have changed in different versions of
Hadoop, you must build Spark against the same version that your cluster runs.
Please refer to the build documentation at
Specifying the Hadoop Version and Enabling YARN
for detailed guidance on building for a particular distribution of Hadoop, including
building for particular Hive and Hive Thriftserver distributions.

Spark is a fast and general cluster computing system for Big Data. It provides
high-level APIs in Scala, Java, Python, and R, and an optimized engine that
supports general computation graphs for data analysis. It also supports a
rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and DataFrames,
MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing,
and Spark Streaming for stream processing.

Spark uses the Hadoop core library to talk to HDFS and other Hadoop-supported
storage systems. Because the protocols have changed in different versions of
Hadoop, you must build Spark against the same version that your cluster runs.
Please refer to the build documentation at

for detailed guidance on building for a particular distribution of Hadoop, including
building for particular Hive and Hive Thriftserver distributions.

Spark is a fast and general cluster computing system for Big Data. It provides
high-level APIs in Scala, Java, Python, and R, and an optimized engine that
supports general computation graphs for data analysis. It also supports a
rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and DataFrames,
MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing,
and Spark Streaming for stream processing.

Spark is built using Apache Maven
To build Spark and its example programs, run:
 You do not need to do this if you downloaded a pre-built package.
You can build Spark using more than one thread by using the -T option with Maven, see "Parallel builds in Maven 3"
For general development tips, including info on developing Spark using an IDE, see 
will run the Pi example locally.
You can set the MASTER environment variable when running examples to submit
examples to a cluster. 
"yarn" to run on YARN, and "local" to run
locally with one thread, or "local" to run locally with N threads. You
can also use an abbreviated class name if the class is in the `examples`
package. For instance: 
Many of the example programs print usage help if no params are given.
Spark uses the Hadoop core library to talk to HDFS and other Hadoop-supported
storage systems. Because the protocols have changed in different versions of
Hadoop, you must build Spark against the same version that your cluster runs.
Please refer to the build documentation at
Specifying the Hadoop Version and Enabling YARN
for detailed guidance on building for a particular distribution of Hadoop, including
building for particular Hive and Hive Thriftserver distributions.

Spark is a fast and general cluster computing system for Big Data. It provides
high-level APIs in Scala, Java, Python, and R, and an optimized engine that
supports general computation graphs for data analysis. It also supports a
rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and DataFrames,
MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing,
and Spark Streaming for stream processing.

Spark is a fast and general cluster computing system for Big Data. It provides
high-level APIs in Scala, Java, Python, and R, and an optimized engine that
supports general computation graphs for data analysis. It also supports a
rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and DataFrames,
MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing,
and Spark Streaming for stream processing.
You can find the latest Spark documentation, including a programming
guide, on the project web page
This README file only contains basic setup instructions.
Spark is built using Apache Maven
To build Spark and its example programs, run:
 You do not need to do this if you downloaded a pre-built package.
You can build Spark using more than one thread by using the -T option with Maven, see "Parallel builds in Maven 3"
For general development tips, including info on developing Spark using an IDE, see 
will run the Pi example locally.
You can set the MASTER environment variable when running examples to submit
examples to a cluster. 
"yarn" to run on YARN, and "local" to run
locally with one thread, or "local" to run locally with N threads. You
can also use an abbreviated class name if the class is in the `examples`
package. For instance: 
Many of the example programs print usage help if no params are given.

Spark uses the Hadoop core library to talk to HDFS and other Hadoop-supported
storage systems. Because the protocols have changed in different versions of
Hadoop, you must build Spark against the same version that your cluster runs.
Please refer to the build documentation at
Specifying the Hadoop Version and Enabling YARN
for detailed guidance on building for a particular distribution of Hadoop, including
building for particular Hive and Hive Thriftserver distributions.

Spark is a fast and general cluster computing system for Big Data. It provides
high-level APIs in Scala, Java, Python, and R, and an optimized engine that
supports general computation graphs for data analysis. It also supports a
rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and DataFrames,
MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing,
and Spark Streaming for stream processing.

Spark uses the Hadoop core library to talk to HDFS and other Hadoop-supported
storage systems. Because the protocols have changed in different versions of
Hadoop, you must build Spark against the same version that your cluster runs.
Please refer to the build documentation at

for detailed guidance on building for a particular distribution of Hadoop, including
building for particular Hive and Hive Thriftserver distributions.

Spark is a fast and general cluster computing system for Big Data. It provides
high-level APIs in Scala, Java, Python, and R, and an optimized engine that
supports general computation graphs for data analysis. It also supports a
rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and DataFrames,
MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing,
and Spark Streaming for stream processing.

 You do not need to do this if you downloaded a pre-built package.
You can build Spark using more than one thread by using the -T option with Maven, see "Parallel builds in Maven 3"
For general development tips, including info on developing Spark using an IDE, see 
will run the Pi example locally.
You can set the MASTER environment variable when running examples to submit
examples to a cluster. 
"yarn" to run on YARN, and "local" to run
locally with one thread, or "local" to run locally with N threads. You
can also use an abbreviated class name if the class is in the `examples`
package. For instance: 
Many of the example programs print usage help if no params are given.
Spark uses the Hadoop core library to talk to HDFS and other Hadoop-supported
storage systems. Because the protocols have changed in different versions of
Hadoop, you must build Spark against the same version that your cluster runs.
Please refer to the build documentation at
Specifying the Hadoop Version and Enabling YARN
for detailed guidance on building for a particular distribution of Hadoop, including
building for particular Hive and Hive Thriftserver distributions.

Spark is a fast and general cluster computing system for Big Data. It provides
high-level APIs in Scala, Java, Python, and R, and an optimized engine that
supports general computation graphs for data analysis. It also supports a
rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and DataFrames,
MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing,
and Spark Streaming for stream processing.

for detailed guidance on building for a particular distribution of Hadoop, including
building for particular Hive and Hive Thriftserver distributions.

Spark is a fast and general cluster computing system for Big Data. It provides
high-level APIs in Scala, Java, Python, and R, and an optimized engine that
supports general computation graphs for data analysis. It also supports a
rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and DataFrames,
MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing,
and Spark Streaming for stream processing.
You can find the latest Spark documentation, including a programming
guide, on the project web page
This README file only contains basic setup instructions.
Spark is built using Apache Maven
To build Spark and its example programs, run:
 You do not need to do this if you downloaded a pre-built package.
You can build Spark using more than one thread by using the -T option with Maven, see "Parallel builds in Maven 3"
For general development tips, including info on developing Spark using an IDE, see 
will run the Pi example locally.
You can set the MASTER environment variable when running examples to submit
examples to a cluster. 
"yarn" to run on YARN, and "local" to run
locally with one thread, or "local" to run locally with N threads. You
can also use an abbreviated class name if the class is in the `examples`
package. For instance: 
Many of the example programs print usage help if no params are given.
Spark uses the Hadoop core library to talk to HDFS and other Hadoop-supported
storage systems. Because the protocols have changed in different versions of
Hadoop, you must build Spark against the same version that your cluster runs.

Spark is built using Apache Maven
To build Spark and its example programs, run:
 You do not need to do this if you downloaded a pre-built package.
You can build Spark using more than one thread by using the -T option with Maven, see "Parallel builds in Maven 3"
For general development tips, including info on developing Spark using an IDE, see 
will run the Pi example locally.
You can set the MASTER environment variable when running examples to submit
examples to a cluster. 
"yarn" to run on YARN, and "local" to run
locally with one thread, or "local" to run locally with N threads. You
can also use an abbreviated class name if the class is in the `examples`
package. For instance: 
Many of the example programs print usage help if no params are given.
Spark uses the Hadoop core library to talk to HDFS and other Hadoop-supported
storage systems. Because the protocols have changed in different versions of
Hadoop, you must build Spark against the same version that your cluster runs.
Please refer to the build documentation at
Specifying the Hadoop Version and Enabling YARN
for detailed guidance on building for a particular distribution of Hadoop, including
building for particular Hive and Hive Thriftserver distributions.

Spark is a fast and general cluster computing system for Big Data. It provides
high-level APIs in Scala, Java, Python, and R, and an optimized engine that
supports general computation graphs for data analysis. It also supports a
rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and DataFrames,
MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing,
and Spark Streaming for stream processing.

Spark uses the Hadoop core library to talk to HDFS and other Hadoop-supported
storage systems. Because the protocols have changed in different versions of
Hadoop, you must build Spark against the same version that your cluster runs.
Please refer to the build documentation at
Specifying the Hadoop Version and Enabling YARN
for detailed guidance on building for a particular distribution of Hadoop, including
building for particular Hive and Hive Thriftserver distributions.

Spark is a fast and general cluster computing system for Big Data. It provides
high-level APIs in Scala, Java, Python, and R, and an optimized engine that
supports general computation graphs for data analysis. It also supports a
rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and DataFrames,
MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing,
and Spark Streaming for stream processing.

Spark uses the Hadoop core library to talk to HDFS and other Hadoop-supported
storage systems. Because the protocols have changed in different versions of
Hadoop, you must build Spark against the same version that your cluster runs.
Please refer to the build documentation at

for detailed guidance on building for a particular distribution of Hadoop, including
building for particular Hive and Hive Thriftserver distributions.

Spark is a fast and general cluster computing system for Big Data. It provides
high-level APIs in Scala, Java, Python, and R, and an optimized engine that
supports general computation graphs for data analysis. It also supports a
rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and DataFrames,
MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing,
and Spark Streaming for stream processing.

supports general computation graphs for data analysis. It also supports a
rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and DataFrames,
MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing,
and Spark Streaming for stream processing.

Spark is built using Apache Maven
To build Spark and its example programs, run:
 You do not need to do this if you downloaded a pre-built package.
You can build Spark using more than one thread by using the -T option with Maven, see "Parallel builds in Maven 3"
For general development tips, including info on developing Spark using an IDE, see 
will run the Pi example locally.
You can set the MASTER environment variable when running examples to submit
examples to a cluster. 
"yarn" to run on YARN, and "local" to run
locally with one thread, or "local" to run locally with N threads. You
can also use an abbreviated class name if the class 
"yarn" to run on YARN, and "local" to run
locally with one thread, or "local" to run locally with N threads. You
can also use an abbreviated class name if the class is in the `examples`
package. For instance: 
Many of the example programs print usage help if no params are given.
Spark uses the Hadoop core library to talk to HDFS and other Hadoop-supported
storage systems. Because the protocols have changed in different versions of
Hadoop, you must build Spark against the same version that your cluster runs.
Please refer to the build documentation at
Specifying the Hadoop Version and Enabling YARN
for detailed guidance on building for a particular distribution of Hadoop, including
building for particular Hive and Hive Thriftserver distributions.

Spark is built using Apache Maven
To build Spark and its example programs, run:
 You do not need to do this if you downloaded a pre-built package.
You can build Spark using more than one thread by using the -T option with Maven, see "Parallel builds in Maven 3"
For general development tips, including info on developing Spark using an IDE, see 
will run the Pi example locally.
You can set the MASTER environment variable when running examples to submit
examples to a cluster. 
"yarn" to run on YARN, and "local" to run
locally with one thread, or "local" to run locally with N threads. You
can also use an abbreviated class name if the class is in the `examples`
package. For instance: 
Many of the example programs print usage help if no params are given.
Spark uses the Hadoop core library to talk to HDFS and other Hadoop-supported
storage systems. Because the protocols have changed in different versions of
Hadoop, you must build Spark against the same version that your cluster runs.
Please refer to the build documentation at
Specifying the Hadoop Version and Enabling YARN
for detailed guidance on building for a particular distribution of Hadoop, including
building for particular Hive and Hive Thriftserver distributions.

Spark is a fast and general cluster computing system for Big Data. It provides
high-level APIs in Scala, Java, Python, and R, and an optimized engine that
supports general computation graphs for data analysis. It also supports a
rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and DataFrames,
MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing,
and Spark Streaming for stream processing.

Spark uses the Hadoop core library to talk to HDFS and other Hadoop-supported
storage systems. Because the protocols have changed in different versions of
Hadoop, you must build Spark against the same version that your cluster runs.
Please refer to the build documentation at

for detailed guidance on building for a particular distribution of Hadoop, including
building for particular Hive and Hive Thriftserver distributions.

Spark is a fast and general cluster computing system for Big Data. It provides
high-level APIs in Scala, Java, Python, and R, and an optimized engine that
supports general computation graphs for data analysis. It also supports a
rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and DataFrames,
MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing,
and Spark Streaming for stream processing.

Hadoop, you must build Spark against the same version that your cluster runs.
Please refer to the build documentation at
Specifying the Hadoop Version and Enabling YARN
for detailed guidance on building for a particular distribution of Hadoop, including
building for particular Hive and Hive Thriftserver distributions.

Spark is a fast and general cluster computing system for Big Data. It provides
high-level APIs in Scala, Java, Python, and R, and an optimized engine that
supports general computation graphs for data analysis. It also supports a
rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and DataFrames,
MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing,
and Spark Streaming for stream processing.
You can find the latest Spark documentation, including a programming
guide, on the project web page
This README file only contains basic setup instructions.
Spark is built using Apache Maven
To build Spark and its example programs, run:
 You do not need to do this if you downloaded a pre-built package.
You can build Spark using more than one thread by using the -T option with Maven, see "Parallel builds in Maven 3"
For general development tips, including info on developing Spark using an IDE, see 
will run the Pi example locally.
You can set the MASTER environment variable when running examples to submit
examples to a cluster. 
"yarn" to run on YARN, and "local" to run
locally with one thread, or "local" to run locally with N threads. You
can also use an abbreviated class name if the class is in the `examples`
package. For instance: 
Many of the example programs print usage help if no params are given.

Spark is built using Apache Maven
To build Spark and its example programs, run:
 You do not need to do this if you downloaded a pre-built package.
You can build Spark using more than one thread by using the -T option with Maven, see "Parallel builds in Maven 3"
For general development tips, including info on developing Spark using an IDE, see 
will run the Pi example locally.
You can set the MASTER environment variable when running examples to submit
examples to a cluster. 
"yarn" to run on YARN, and "local" to run
locally with one thread, or "local" to run locally with N threads. You
can also use an abbreviated class name if the class is in the `examples`
package. For instance: 
Many of the example programs print usage help if no params are given.
Spark uses the Hadoop core library to talk to HDFS and other Hadoop-supported
storage systems. Because the protocols have changed in different versions of
Hadoop, you must build Spark against the same version that your cluster runs.
Please refer to the build documentation at
Specifying the Hadoop Version and Enabling YARN
for detailed guidance on building for a particular distribution of Hadoop, including
building for particular Hive and Hive Thriftserver distributions.

Spark is a fast and general cluster computing system for Big Data. It provides
high-level APIs in Scala, Java, Python, and R, and an optimized engine that
supports general computation graphs for data analysis. It also supports a

Spark uses the Hadoop core library to talk to HDFS and other Hadoop-supported
storage systems. Because the protocols have changed in different versions of
Hadoop, you must build Spark against the same version that your cluster runs.
Please refer to the build documentation at

for detailed guidance on building for a particular distribution of Hadoop, including
building for particular Hive and Hive Thriftserver distributions.

Spark is a fast and general cluster computing system for Big Data. It provides
high-level APIs in Scala, Java, Python, and R, and an optimized engine that
supports general computation graphs for data analysis. It also supports a
rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and DataFrames,
MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing,
and Spark Streaming for stream processing.

Spark uses the Hadoop core library to talk to HDFS and other Hadoop-supported
storage systems. Because the protocols have changed in different versions of
Hadoop, you must build Spark against the same version that your cluster runs.
Please refer to the build documentation at
Specifying the Hadoop Version and Enabling YARN
for detailed guidance on building for a particular distribution of Hadoop, including
building for particular Hive and Hive Thriftserver distributions.

Spark is a fast and general cluster computing system for Big Data. It provides
high-level APIs in Scala, Java, Python, and R, and an optimized engine that
supports general computation graphs for data analysis. It also supports a
rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and DataFrames,
MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing,
and Spark Streaming for stream processing.
